# Docker-First Development Workflow

- All services (web, db, redis, worker) must be built and run via **docker compose**.
- When adding new dependencies:
  1. Update `package.json` **and** the relevant `Dockerfile`.
  2. Run `docker compose build <service>`; do **not** run `npm install` locally.
- When writing README snippets or test scripts, prefix commands with `docker compose exec <service>`.
- Do not modify `docker-compose.yml` or any `Dockerfile` unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Never mount the host’s `node_modules` into containers; rely on images’ own installs.

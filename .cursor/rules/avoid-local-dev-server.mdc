# DO NOT run local dev servers

- Never execute `npm run dev`, `npm run start`, `node server.js`, or any similar command.
- Assume the backend and frontend are **already running inside Docker containers** started via `docker-compose up -d`.
- If a code change requires a restart, respond with:
  > “Dockerized services will auto-reload via volume mounts; no manual restart needed.”
- Use `docker compose logs -f <service>` to inspect runtime output when necessary.
- **Never** issue `docker compose down`, `docker compose restart`, or container-killing commands without explicit user confirmation.
